PostgreSQL REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

To use PostgreSQL with your Serverphu installation, the following requirements
must be met: Server has PHP 5.5 or later with PDO, and the PDO pgsql driver 
must be enabled.

CREATE THE PostgreSQL DATABASE
------------------------------

Note that the database must be created with UTF-8 (Unicode) encoding.

1. CREATE DATABASE USER

   This step is only necessary if you don't already have a user set up (e.g., by
   your host), or want to create a new user for use with Serverphu only. The
   following command creates a new user named 'username' and asks for a password
   for that user (make sure to remember that password so you can enter it in 
   app/settings.php):

     createuser --pwprompt --encrypted --no-createrole --no-createdb username

   If there are no errors, then the command was successful.

2. CREATE SERVERPHU DATABASE

   This step is only necessary if you don't already have a database set up
   (e.g., by your host) or want to create a new database for use with Serverphu
   only. The following command creates a new database named 'databasename',
   which is owned by the previously created 'username':

     createdb --encoding=UTF8 --owner=username databasename

   If there are no errors, then the command was successful.

3. CREATE SCHEMA

   Serverphu will need to run in the schema that you specify in 
   app/settings.php:

     CREATE SCHEMA schema_name AUTHORIZATION username;
